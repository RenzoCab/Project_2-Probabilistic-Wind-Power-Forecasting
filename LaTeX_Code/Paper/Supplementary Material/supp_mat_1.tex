\section{Seasonality effect}

To guaranty an homogeneous year, we study the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each provider and for each day. In Figures (\ref{MAE_pA}), (\ref{MAE_pB}), and (\ref{MAE_pC}), we can see the daily and weekly MAE for the providers A, B, and C, respectively.\\
To compute the vector that we are piloting, we realize the operation
\begin{equation*}
\hat{V}(j) =\frac{1}{145} \sum_{i=1}^{145}|V(i,j)|\quad\text{where}\quad j\in\{1,\dots,147\}.
\end{equation*}
Recall that $V(i,j)$ is the normalized error between the ADME real production and the UTE forecast at time $i$ and for the day $j$.

\caption{Daily and weekly for the provider C.}
\label{MAE_pC}
\end{figure}

\section{Hourly effect}

We want to see the error throughout the day. We compute the MAE for each provider for each measurement during the day. In Figures (\ref{HMAE_pA}), (\ref{HMAE_pB}), and (\ref{HMAE_pC}), we can see the hourly MAE for the providers A, B, and C, respectively.\\

To compute the vector that we are piloting, we realize the operation
\begin{equation*}
\hat{V}(i) =\frac{1}{147} \sum_{j=1}^{147}|V(i,j)|\quad\text{where}\quad i\in\{1,\dots,145\}.
\end{equation*}
Recall that $V(i,j)$ is the normalized error between the ADME real production and the UTE forecast at time $i$ and for the day $j$.\\

\end{figure}

\section{Forecast Error Vs Forecast:}

We plot the forecast error as a function of the forecast value for each provider. In Figures (\ref{sA}), (\ref{sB}), and (\ref{sC}), we can see this plots for the providers A, B, and C, respectively.
