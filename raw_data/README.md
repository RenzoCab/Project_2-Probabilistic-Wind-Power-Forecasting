## Data from CAMS
1.  Raditon <\br>

 Title: CAMS McClear v3.0 model of clear-sky irradiation.
 Content:  A time-series of solar radiation received on horizontal plane and plane always normal to the sun rays at ground level assuming clear sky.
           Calls on the McClear clear-sky model. Returns the global, beam and diffuse irradiations integrated over a selected time step,
           for a selected location (worldwide coverage) and a selected period.
 The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union within the Copernicus programme.
 Provider: MINES ParisTech (France)
