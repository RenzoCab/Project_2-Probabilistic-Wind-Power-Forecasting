The sheet consists of 5 sheets. The first 4 are the forecasts
At 72 hours for the period from 01-Oct-16 to 30-Nov-16. The issue is
that they create 4 forecasts per day, at 3am, 9am, 3pm and 9pm.
The rows correspond to each day, and in the columns is the hour.
For the rows painted in yellow no prognoses were made, be careful.

The fifth sheet is the "real active power" over the universe of
Parks analyzed (not all parks). Please note the following: the sum of the nominal (maximum) power of the sample of
21 parks analyzed is 1156.5MW. All energy data
(Actual and forecast) are in MWh.

All the best
Raul

Dear Raul,
    thank you! 
It seems that these data include the predictions that are updated every 6hours.
Also, the total capacity must be larger than  the  previous sets, I see more than 800MW production, although in the previous dataset the total capacity they give us is 794MW.
Did they send any details about total capacity and information on the numerical prediction model?
