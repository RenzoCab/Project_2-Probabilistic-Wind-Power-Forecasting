The solar generation data analyzed correspond to the 366 days of the year 2016.\
The total power generated was recorded hourly and these quantities were\
normalized by the total installed power1, so that the data take values\
between 0 and 1. The values \uc0\u8203 \u8203 of the series correspond to the energy generated in 2016 by\
3 photovoltaic farms, the characteristics of which are listed in the following table\

It is necessary that the summer and spring seasons have very\
similar, both in mean value and dispersion, and are the stations with the highest level\
photovoltaic production. In turn, the behavior of the\
and winter is very similar between s, and in those months 30% less than\
solar generation than in spring or summer.\
Shown below are the average values \uc0\u8203 \u8203 and time scales\
for summer and winter seasons.\

It is observed that in a mid-summer d is generated 19% more energy than in\
the average annual day, and in a mid-winter of 19% less energy than in the\
average annual day. Also the dispersions are 20% smaller in both seasons\
than the dispersion of the total data set.\

the days of summer and winter, and are also recorded in their respective average values\

It is observed that there are a few days of winter in which for hours of noon\
plant factors close to unity, but the number of such factors is\
significantly lower than for the summer, which explains the appreciable difference\
in the mean solar generation curves of both seasons.\
We also investigate seasonal seasonal dispersion in source generation\
solar.\

This dispersion measure compares the area under the curves of plant factors\
stations of the station X (j) with the area corresponding to the curve of the plant factor\
average daily of said station X (0), and averages those quantities.\
The following table evaluates the dispersion measure in the solar generation for\
the seasons of summer and winter. It also includes as a reference the value of the\
average daily energy Ee of each station. All values \uc0\u8203 \u8203 are normalized\
with respect to the installed solar power.\

It is necessary that the relative dispersion in the daily energy generated in winter is of the\
order twice as much as for summer days.\
